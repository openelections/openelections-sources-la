## Project Description 📖

To contribute or import your own data, please refer to [Pelican Bot](pelbot/README.md) for detailed setup and running instructions.

PelicanBot is an automated tool designed to scrape and collect election result data for the state of Louisiana from the Secretary of State's website.

## Data Integrity & Sources 🔍
We prioritize data integrity by sourcing information directly from the Louisiana Secretary of State's official channels. Election result data is collected from their [Graphical Election Results Tool](https://voterportal.sos.la.gov/Graphical), which provides authentic and verifiable source files.

## Contributing 🤝
We welcome contributions from volunteers to improve and expand the dataset. Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the [openelections-core repository](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-core).
